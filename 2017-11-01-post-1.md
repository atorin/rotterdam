title: the first readers?
style: clarity
---

or at least i hope so, as two frriends asked me about it and i sent
them the link.

this marks a watershed for this blog that i had abandoned. if i really
had some readers they were the first ones, but how to know if i really
had some readers?

my preferred way to know is to receive some feedback from them, but is
this blog receptive to feedback?
