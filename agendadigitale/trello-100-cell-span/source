cambiamo approccio? fra le issues ODT/DOCX -> RST quali hanno la priorità

is there any issue about rendering widths in RST?

custom widths are not shown anyway

how are such custom widths rendered in RST?
looking at the example

and having an existing implementation would still be helpful
that can happen also in other cases

but the work will have to be redone if the data model changes
i think that most of the work will be in the reader and writer

i'm not sure that the idea is useful, i can consider it later
when i will know better the reading and writing functions

so i can have a `Div ("", [], [("col-span", 3)])`
type TableCell = [Block]
