and having an existing implementation would still be helpful
that can happen also in other cases

but the work will have to be redone if the data model changes
i think that most of the work will be in the reader and writer

i'm not sure that the idea is useful, i can consider it later
when i will know better the reading and writing functions

so i can have a `Div ("", [], [("col-span", 3)])`
type TableCell = [Block]
