 i want to understand resolveDependentRunStyle
before merging

but most of all, walking the critical path first
limiting the amount of complexity to tackle at once for this task
proposing a small change set and
a bit defensive towards
i'm hacking in the minimal functionality, for polishing it later

(

that finer tests are a good investment at the moment
given that the interface is not great i'm not sure anymore

type NameSpaces = [(String, String)]
 
elemToRun :: NameSpaces -> Element -> D Run

via finer tests
while new contributors can easier be introduced to interesting parts
the authors probably have a deeper knowledge of the dynamics
except for Jesse Rosenthal (jkr) and John McFarlane
this file didn't see much contribution
but finer tests can help also newcomers in the future
tests aren't that fine-grained at the moment

)

 namespaces passed everywhere
 WrongElem
 isElement used multiple times and within element-specific functions
refactoring

there are many maybes in the code

uncomfortable code
a simple idea for starters
this longer task

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-1.3.14/docs/Text-XML-Light-Types.html#t:Element

idea che avevo Ã¨: se si riesce a identificare il font, e si usa
courier per formattare il codice in DOCX, basterebbe quello per creare
la formattazione adeguata in RST

semantic font
