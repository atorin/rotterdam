 i think that it's dereferencing a style name
 

 i want to understand resolveDependentRunStyle
before merging

i developed this as an option but it could be an extension like `styles`

options

stack build && stack exec doc-font-to-style-exe "Courier 10 Pitch" < ../pandoc/test/docx/fonts-as-attributes.docx | pandoc -f json -t rst

but most of all, walking the critical path first
limiting the amount of complexity to tackle at once for this task
proposing a small change set and
a bit defensive towards
i'm hacking in the minimal functionality, for polishing it later

uncomfortable code
a simple idea for starters
this longer task
