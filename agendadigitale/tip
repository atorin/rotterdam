- what causes the header border size?
- why has the fifth column been sliced away?
- where was the number of specs taken from?
questions
- broken header borders
- four cells for headers and rows
- three specs
the result from frankenstein presents

the current checked out file corresponds to the result from upstream

so the question is how is the specs length calculated?
the original table seems to have multiple columns
even with frankenstein the three specs would slice some content away
the native code has three default specs altough it starts with five headers

maybe building different versions with stack won't take much time
if most dependencies are the same

running a frankenstein with 4059 should fix

ghc-pkg unregister <package>

what causes a table to be built this way?

running plain pandoc i can compare the results

- variable cell number -- it seems like the fix isn't applied
- missing the last border -- may be a mismatch between cells and separators
- formatting -- not sure there is a way to get this right

one can assume that a builder was called with some arguments
the builders run while parsing the DOCX
i guess that here again the problems are from native to markup

i can extend type tests with the native version of the complex table

i flew to systems design and now back to table cells

in the night because motivation goes beyond daily routine

is frankenstein broken? having troubles running tests with cabal
