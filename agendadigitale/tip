what causes a table to be built this way?

the native code has three default specs altough it starts with five headers

running plain pandoc i can compare the results

- variable cell number -- it seems like the fix isn't applied
- missing the last border -- may be a mismatch between cells and separators
- formatting -- not sure there is a way to get this right

one can assume that a builder was called with some arguments
the builders run while parsing the DOCX
i guess that here again the problems are from native to markup

i can extend type tests with the native version of the complex table

i flew to systems design and now back to table cells

in the night because motivation goes beyond daily routine

is frankenstein broken? having troubles running tests with cabal
