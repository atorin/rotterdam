a synthesised document has (w:p (w:pPr (w:pStyle SourceCode)) (w:r (...)) ... )

the CodeBlock parsing in Readers.Docx is responsible for the fragmentation

hum the matter here seems more tricky than expected. code in
`tests/15.docx` is translated by pandoc as one CodeBlock per line,
while passing through libreoffice 5.1.6.2 it gets translated as one paragraph
per line. also pandoc would save a CodeBlock as a simple paragraph

after conversion to ODT the paragraph looks styled like "source code"

 pandoc-test (danse)$ pandoc tests/15.odt -t rst
<code>

<some code here>Hey!</some code here>

</code>

Here’s some text

l'obiettivo é collezionare documenti in un unico index.rst
diviso per sezioni o capitoli
ogni file corrisponderà ad un sito
ogni cosa ben tradotta da pandoc evita lavoro manuale tedioso
