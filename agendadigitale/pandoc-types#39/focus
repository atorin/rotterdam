maybe i'm using assertBool the wrong way

  test walk: [Failed]
  test everywhere: [OK]
  test p_walk: [OK]

walk fails, everywhere succeeds, yet the comparison succeeds
something is wrong

i added the test with everywhere and it succeeds, that means that this kind of nesting ne
these can be considered experiments

that could hint to some error in the generics logic
the easiest is to check whether everywhere shows the same problem

Block derives Generics and all the types in the sum do so in the same way

the problem could be in the way generics are defined for a bullet list
and a table

This is obviously a serious problem, which we should fix, and having the test case in this repository will help ensure we don't forget, so maybe you could submit a PR with just the failing test, for now?

Trying to reproduce with syb generics and everything would also be a good idea. If the problem can't be reproduced there, we have to wonder why QuickCheck never found the problem, and it would be good to explain that.

the code here is highly abstract
