pandoc is powering the italian public administration

in an ambitious modernisation program rolled out by the current italian government, we are developing a document flow based on standard formats like ODT and RST, and free software like pandoc.

it's the first time i work for an institution in my country, and the general expectation here, to use an euphemism, is that there is a lot of work to be done before our public services can be considered efficient. nonetheless this time i've been impressed by the quality of the project.

not only we are eschewing lock-in by relying on free software, not only the selection of the technology is, for once, one of the most advanced i know of, but we are also careful to contribute upstream as much as possible for a sustainable development

this is a double success story for haskell: on one side, pandoc has been picked for its qualities and features, not out of opinions or expectations about the language it has been written in. on the other hand as a beginner on this big project i've been impressed by the results we could achieve so far

the momentum on pandoc seems to be growing in the last months, with a significant daily volume of contributions and open issues. the project encompasses a plethora of formats and it would be easy in these conditions to grow bloated software and to collect hacks.

i am passionate about free software but in the past i found it hard to contribute to big javascript and python projects
