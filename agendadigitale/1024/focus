the data model supports cell spans over non-contiguous cells

well-formedness can be easily verified

Cell = Attr [Blocks] | Ext
Table = Table Int Int [Cell]

a
 b
  *
*
 c
  d
e
 e
  *

a b b
a c d
e e d

i can imagine some ways to encode the table that would enforce some of the properties related to well-formed spans, but not all of the properties. i think that it's not worth having a complex data model if it doesn't give us strong guarantees ... better to keep it simple and write validation logic in the builders as you suggest

we can generate random well-formed tables built in this data model

we have no guarantee that the parsed table is well-formed

how would an oldToNew function look like

~/pandoc-types    -- to develop pandoc-types
~/fork/..         -- to build or cross-develop
~/jgm/..          -- for comparisons
