type Rowspan = Int
type Colspan = Int
type Caption = [Block]
type ShortCaption = [Inline]
type Colwidth = Maybe Double
data Cell = Cell       Attr Rowspan Colspan [Block]
          | HeaderCell Attr Rowspan Colspan [Block]
          | NoCell -- if this slot is taken by anoter cell's row/colspan (idea from docutils snippet above)
type Row = [Cell]
-- constructor for Table in Block:
   | Table Attr Caption ShortCaption [(Alignment, Colwidth)] [Row]








data Cell = Cell [BodyPart]
            deriving Show

Tbl String TblGrid TblLook [Row]

and having an existing implementation would still be helpful
that can happen also in other cases

but the work will have to be redone if the data model changes
i think that most of the work will be in the reader and writer

candidate data models
i'm not sure that the idea is useful, i can consider it later
when i will know better the reading and writing functions

so i can have a `Div ("", [], [("col-span", 3)])`
type TableCell = [Block]

the last proposal from jgm is rather essential
by proposing a pull request with these core changes i can help unlocking
but there can be a set of core changes enabling the community to help
this feature seems rather far because it requires a lot of changes

it also has comments in general about the data model but it seems ignored
first comment on dependent types, the second is the proposal by mb21

a more precise estimation can be very useful for planning

we can generate random well-formed tables built in this data model
we have no guarantee that the parsed table is well-formed
