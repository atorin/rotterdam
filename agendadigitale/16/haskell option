 is there anybody who is parsing PDF files in a workflow involving pandoc?
we are considering alternatives but there seem to be surprisingly few.
i couldn't find any issue nor pull request nor discussion related to
PDF parsing.  we are not restricting ourselves to haskell, but being
able to translate a PDF file to pandoc types would be very valuable,
as it would lead to clean and robust translation to a variety of
formats.  as for how to achieve it the best option in haskell seems to
be https://github.com/Yuras/pdf-toolbox. i'm not sure about the policy
of pandoc about external libraries but given the lack of alternatives
it seems to make sense to delegate parsing to an external library, at
least at the beginning. alternatively i'm considering the option of
wrapping other libraries:
github.com/public-law/analyze-oregon-law-haskell seems to use
effectively the tika library written in java
