replace RST rubrics with strong text
- rubrics are less readable than strong text markup
- 


this is rendered as a rubric because it's not at top level

rubrics were added here
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/2079

here we have rubrics outside 
rubrics.native

in `box.rst` one can see the parsing error. the parser seems to fail
recognising that the link is continuing to a new line

https://github.com/atorin/pandoc-test/issues/24

filter or pandoc?
reduced to the minimum, but it seems to be an unrelated error
there was a link but i simplified
[Para [Strong [Space], Strong [Space]]]

l'obiettivo é collezionare documenti in un unico index.rst
diviso per sezioni o capitoli
ogni file corrisponderà ad un sito
ogni cosa ben tradotta da pandoc evita lavoro manuale tedioso
