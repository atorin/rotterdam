in the RST reader and the writer
i should add the feature in a whole different way
considering that this convention exists
loose lists in an RST file will be packed if the file is passed through pandoc
this is available for markdown but missing in RST

we could consider encoding it explicitely using a div with attribute
isTightList is like an informal encoding

isTightList https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/src/Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs#L542-L546

4410

4422

local copy of the RST doc

producing the same error
the central escaped space is kept this way also in our fork
there was a link but i simplified
[Para [Strong [Space], Strong [Space]]]
 inline space

i wasn't able to reduce the test case, the code can guide me
in box.rst one can see the parsing error. the parser seems to fail
recognising that the link is continuing to a new line
 long link in a table

headers 4373

tables 1024

l'obiettivo é collezionare documenti in un unico index.rst
diviso per sezioni o capitoli
ogni file corrisponderà ad un sito
ogni cosa ben tradotta da pandoc evita lavoro manuale tedioso
