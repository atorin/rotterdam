i reckon the idea i had to detect such cases in the reader was wrong because these cases depend on the writing format

good catch, the same problem has been tackled in the markdown writer. there the solution has been to duplicate the parsing logic in the writer and to handle the case of lists separately. furthermore, list markers are escaped only when a given extension is active

olMarker which duplicates orderedListStart

it doesn't seem to be escapeString because it's applied also to plain text

4422

local copy of the RST doc

producing the same error
the central escaped space is kept this way also in our fork
there was a link but i simplified
[Para [Strong [Space], Strong [Space]]]
 inline space

i wasn't able to reduce the test case, the code can guide me
in box.rst one can see the parsing error. the parser seems to fail
recognising that the link is continuing to a new line
 long link in a table

headers 4373

tables 1024

l'obiettivo é collezionare documenti in un unico index.rst
diviso per sezioni o capitoli
ogni file corrisponderà ad un sito
ogni cosa ben tradotta da pandoc evita lavoro manuale tedioso
