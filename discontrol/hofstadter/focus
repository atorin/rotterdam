from those the speaker intended
who may take a set of actions which are quite different
we are dealing with an intellingent interpreter
this program writing is indirect in the sense that
within the hearer's cognitive system
one that indirectly causes a set of operations to be carried out
we can think of any utterance as a program
a way of activating procedures within the hearer
all language use can be though of as

the structure of shrdlu by winograd 628

so that the further you go the less predictable they get
exhibit increasing complexity of behavior
some types of recursively defined sequences
it might seem that

new things emerge from old things by rules
recursive enumeration is a process in which

instead of explicitly
defining in terms of simpler versions
this is the essence of recursion

each new element being compounded out of previous elements
thus the set grows

by repeated application of rules of inference
means that it can be generated from a set of starting elements
for a set to be recursively enumerable

recursion and unpredictability 152

term due to warren mcculloch

is called a heterarchy
in which there is no single "highest level" or "monitor"
a program which has such a structure

calling each other and themselves like crazy
there can be a whole family of networks which are all tangled up

indirect recursion

bottoming out and heterarchies 133

tension and resolution are the hearth and soul of music
because it is a piece of irony
a local resolution should heighten the global tension rather than relieving it

with two keys, the tonic and the pseudotonic
any reasonably musical person automatically maintains a shallow stack

this is an exaggeration 
until the tonic is reached
we want to hear the sequence of keys retracted in reverse order
and each new modulation pushes a new key into the stack
we maintain a mental stack of keys

stacks in music 129

and resume operations where left off one level deeper
close operations on one level
to pop is the reverse

and to take up a new task
without forgetting where you are
to push means to suspend operations on the task you're currently working on

one of the first languages for artificial intelligence
introduced in the late 50's as part of IPL
push, pop and push-down stack
basic terminology of recursion in computer science:

pushing, popping and stacks 128

often of the same type
in favor of a simpler task
is when you postpone completing a task
one of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life

in terms of a simpler version of itself
a recursive definition always defines something

nesting and variations on nesting

what is recursion? 127

we can mirror some of it inside our heads
the world is a giant heap of randomness

the approach to creativity has begun
when programs cease to be transparent to their creators

yet every creative act is mechanical
creativity is the essence of what is not mechanical
