first of all, i use firefox. it has a decent location bar, where by
decent i meant that it does what it should.

with the firefox location bar i can type few letters of the name of a
friend or community, and enter directly into their profile.

this fixes manipulation, because i'm driven directly by my thoughts,
and i access directly to the friend's contents sorted as they want to
sort them.

this fixes lock-in, because when a friend or community will decide to
switch to their own website, it will be easy for me to type their site
rather than their nickname.

this way social media like Facebook or Twitter just serve as a testing
and growing ground for future publishers
