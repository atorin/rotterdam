title: i've been working on stacks
----

i started working on stacks in july
now i start using them everywhere
and the work done is helpful
i'm impressed by how long-term has the work been
and how deep, connecting so many aspects of using technology

it comes from concepts that i've been thinking about since the second year of university, and that started from the desire to generalise some concepts related to implementations of processors and computing

now it's early to say whether this is something useful only to me or whether it can be explained and it can be helpful also to others
