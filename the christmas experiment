didn't want to adapt my lifestyle to theirs and feel uncomfortable.

the beginning was exhalting. i wasn't stopping my adventure, i was
just extending it to different conditions, a new challenge.

i tried nomading to places similar to my town before, and i knew that
traditional nomading techniques wouldn't work ...

~ the AirBnB market is prohibitive being aimed mainly at tourists, the coworkings are not reacheable and there are no bars that are thought for digital nomads.

the same old streets where i grew up appeared to me in a completely
different light. i made new friends, travellers like me. i saw the
town from their eyes.

it's incredible how unwelcoming my own small town is.

this area is economically depressed, yet there is no way to give
somebody money in order to stay in one of the many empty houses in the
city center.

the bars are empty, yet they won't allow you to work comfortably
there. the coworking spaces seem designed for the locals, they require
a car in order to be reached and a long-term stay.

paradoxically i realise that it would be easier for me to move to a
different continent and culture rather than live comfortably in my
town. my town doesn't welcome people like me.
