they reduce accessibility to a single tip thus focus
or if there are several
but only one currently accessible
there can be many tips in different namespaces

stack | tip | focus | leaf | branch | trunk

where mental stress is not required
rooting is my focusing
many tips but one focus

so a tip is more exclusive and valuable
a name can encompass way more than a limited visual or phisical space
 or choosing contents to call the tip
 my choosing contents for the top
one can expose, focus
in a stack without top, there can be a tip

and rising with its leaves
browsing a growing forest

more freely
where leaves can grow
a bit closer to us
there is ground and there is air

to some ground, which is chaotic
or the cursor, or the focus, or the attention
when one is able to move the tip
deeper rooting starts
here the vegetal metaphore becomes messy
rooting can start moving the tip from trunk to trunk
the tip is not related to any trunk
and anti-informatics
so it's an anti-hierarchy
the tip is the source of the flow
and a trunk
there is a tip
stacks make trees or fractals because they develop recursively

my ground is also my highest sky
through respectful happy nodes
while i open that capacity

work as an activity grounded on (regulated by) money making
or productivity
can be seen as paths to a desirable root

a root is set externally but a center is felt internally

i sit comfortably on my uncomfortable root

then detect when they get lost
work for the conditions to be there
for example productivity and comfort
one can select specific conditions desired in the setting
a root is easier to analise than a process

my unpleasant root is giving me a lot of gems once i made it enjoyable

a root taints anything that leads there
the more sensitive the more far away the tainting from the actionable root
consistent symptoms require more work to be understood
