space, search, dive in, jump out

a conversation can be seen as a shared stack

it's the system of recursive amplification
which leads to directionality of chaotic systems over time
which makes stacks so powerful

 primitives
push pop scan remove edit save swapstack
clear is just on some stacks
append on most
clear-append is awkward in emacs
separate archive
autoremove or sort
free, when you detach

almost anything supports stack algorithms

how many brilliant people you know that keep stacks of magazines around?
