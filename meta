the ground offers limited resources
often not renewable as we want
not understanding its cycles leads to frustration
not respecting its role leads to loss
insisting can lead to damage

elements on a stack can refer to the ground
kind of creating a new ground upon which one can root

top    change      movement listening     generosity freedom        creation
bottom improvement solidity understanding respect    sustainability maintenance

i have no hurry to formalise such algorithms
algorithms on stacks aim to minimize the impact of these limitations
we work on tops of stacks due to limitations in our process

stacks have many tops and one bottom, ground
which can generate always new stacks
a root is there to transform the ground
growing stacks

grounding, packing

partially ordered by dependency
stacks primitives and algorithms form a set
i wanto comfort not to be too unevenly distributed on the set

space, search, dive in, jump out

a conversation can be seen as a shared stack

it's the system of recursive amplification
which leads to directionality of chaotic systems over time
which makes stacks so powerful

 primitives
push pop scan remove edit save swapstack
clear is just on some stacks
append on most
clear-append is awkward in emacs
separate archive
autoremove or sort
free, when you detach

almost anything supports stack algorithms

how many brilliant people you know that keep stacks of magazines around?
