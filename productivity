and now i like a public space better, but i can look for the space suited to the task

i found it back while asking what did it mean to me to be productive today. when did i lose it? i think when i started studying Hofstadter's book. that effort drained up all other efforts

after relaxing, suddently i remember my ambitious goal, and that gives direction to the whole productivity effort which seemed to be in a stall. avevo perso di vista la mia visione e ci√≤ mi rendeva meno efficace, privo di direzione























what does it mean to be productive today? how to be, what's the best
option i have in order to be

for some reason i feel like 'chore' should be an important category in
the productivity sprint
