and now i like a public space better, but i can look for the space suited to the task

i found it back while asking what did it mean to me to be productive today. when did i lose it? i think when i started studying Hofstadter's book. that effort drained up all other efforts

after relaxing, suddently i remember my ambitious goal, and that gives direction to the whole productivity effort which seemed to be in a stall. avevo perso di vista la mia visione e ci√≤ mi rendeva meno efficace, privo di direzione























what does it mean to be productive today? how to be, what's the best
option i have in order to be

for some reason i feel like 'chore' should be an important category in
the productivity sprint





it might be a good idea to reintroduce the red notebook. that should
be the entry point for new tasks. it's harder for me to think deep in
front of a screen, and often i have a problems with connectivity or
power or i don't have the laptop with me. having a paper-based entry
point for new tasks can fix all of this.

a stack data structure prioritises recent items, so that the writer is
always empowered to the maximum. this is the kind of attitude i want
the system to enable, so as a rule last items have the highest
priority.

this also enables to write with full power on different instances.

this also means that not following the list is respecting priorities.

when creating a new stack, it's useful to do so by keeping some
reference to the previous stack, even just in the name. this way they
can be followed back respecting the priorities
