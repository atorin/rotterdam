be the entry point for new tasks. it's harder for me to think deep in
front of a screen, and often i have a problems with connectivity or
power or i don't have the laptop with me. having a paper-based entry
point for new tasks can fix all of this.

a stack data structure prioritises recent items, so that the writer is
always empowered to the maximum. this is the kind of attitude i want
the system to enable, so as a rule last items have the highest
priority.

this also enables to write with full power on different instances.
