Kim Albrecht’s talk will show how glitches reveal the inner workings of the systems we trust everyday and how visualisations can help us in our algorithm-driven society.

Kim Albrecht visualizes cultural, technological, and scientific forms of knowledge. His diagrams are meant to unfold and question the structures of representation and explore the aesthetic of the intermingling of technology and society through the sensual knowledge of tracing information.

Peter Crnokrak’s talk will focus on the historical dynamics of war and conflict and its effect on human creative output by surveying the last 500 years of scientific discoveries and artistic creations.

Peter Crnokrak is a computational artist whose work addresses the ever changing reference point of reality and experience, with a particular focus on the extremes of societal behaviour as a means by which to characterise the human condition. His practice is an experimental platform that utilises symbolic logic to communicate meaning in complex systems with work integrating research, analysis and experimental technologies.

e dove la gente non si sente prigioniera
del paese per giustificare la mentalità
dove non c'é bisogno di nascondersi dietro la dimensione
i posti più evoluti sono i paesi piccoli

é essere una pecora colorata
l'unico modo di non essere una pecora

define markets
and regulations of services
like the mail
in a publc system
a service is a private slot

thought is still predated
in different ways
but our society accepts most of them
like in a advertisement
and we know some of them
with tools that became more sophisticated over time
by agents of social control
it's also an activity that's been always predated
it's in generela not an easy activity in itself
probably neve r been that easy to think
it's easier to be brainwashed
because it's not so easy for us to think
and i imagine other people are in the same situation
or do it right or the way i like it
and i've probably always wanted to do more of it
but i often had to look for it elsewhere
i actually always enjoyed it a lot
now i realise
to spend time thinking
i wouldn't feel allowed
because i couldn't enjoy thinking because
i couldn't think the way i liked

start doing something, lame on the ground. distractions arrive anyway

to remove all the pressure from the start of the day
per eliminare il senso di colpa
