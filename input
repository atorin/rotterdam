spontaneously closing eyes
shower effect

a mark on moving matter

by thinking in another language one can avoid the mental censorship
related to the others

generations versioning the most recent is the closest

stacks like trees grow out of their containers overgrow plants
generations

river from the ground energy pools overflow tainting

you find yourself staying nomad doing things that can carry you around

hi how are you doing it's been a while ... i kept thinking about the
project we worked together some time ago. i was imagining some
interfaces for optimal sharing of information and remote collaboration
and i came to think about your project and i wonder how it's going

the anonymicity of items in a stack is the optimal condition at the
moment of storing but the worse at the moment of accessing,
retrieving. that's why many stacks benefit from processing strategies
and that's why it makes sense to have some abstract concepts of the
tip of a stack and the heterarchy of priorities. it's an heterarchy
without a common root. it features multiple paths and multiple
roots. but the structure gives us paths and a program and an abstract
structure to look at as organisation and communicate, clarify, be part
of the heterarchical system

french india, otherwise the portugese

a stack should automatically move edited plants to the top

i want to be open for the meeting

and that is the moment when it can start accelerating
before the engine will start running again
if expectations are ambitious it could take a while
and you can move freely and the task at hand is uninteresting
when an engine is broken nothing is going on through it, calma piatta

silence break, butterfly break, kleinemusic session

stack tip man sky
ground tip man sky

i can follow the spontaneous clues and reflect levels
it will take the resources needed for following it
i cannot follow the complex plan if i understand it
