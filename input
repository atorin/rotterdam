  

like in a...
and we know some of them
with tools that became more sophisticated over time
by agents of social control
it's also being always predated
it's in generela not an easy activity
probably neve r that easy
it's easier to be brainwashed
because it's not so easy for us to think
and i imagine other people are in the same situation
or do it right or the way i like it
and i've probably always wanted to do more of it
but i often had to look for it elsewhere
i actually always enjoyed it a lot
now i realise
to spend time thinking
i wouldn't feel allowed
because i couldn't enjoy thinking because
i couldn't think the way i liked

start doing something, lame on the ground. distractions arrive anyway

to remove all the pressure from the start of the day
per eliminare il senso di colpa
