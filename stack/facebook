hey folks what about... ,
i mean have you ever seen some hippies here in ragusa?
or what did you make of them?
there weren't concentration camps for foreigners at the time
there wasn't a fascist mindset
alright tell me the non-address of their batcave
where i can meet the joyful bunch
the ones i've already met are brave and beautiful
but they feel lonely and a bit lost
