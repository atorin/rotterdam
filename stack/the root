the root is the place where ideas hit us and become ours
when they hit us they create a branch that has our name on it
a branch in time and space, at least
that keeps branching, giving us options
that's what makes us feel free
there is some egocentrism in every branch
the root has to be very personal for me
in order to conceive ideas that seem worth pursuing
i can be very selective about technology that's part of one of my roots
even to the point of intentionally reducing technology as much as possible
even to zero
think about living with zero technology
i did many times
