an operator should be on the same line or on the next one? it depends
whether you want to express connection or not. an operator on the same
line suggests that the two lines should be read together, while an
operator on the next line suggests that the line has a bare value and
makes it easier to move it around

i modi di divertirsi cambiano, anche se a volte per varie ragioni non
ce ne accorgiamo o non ce ne interessiamo. in una economia del
benessere, il modo in cui ti diverti é quello che forma l'economia e

frontiera del divertimento e del benessere non lascerà molta traccia
in quel futuro, il futuro dove tutti possiamo passarcela meglio. il
dovere può distruggerci tanto quanto il piacere.

can i get to a bubble with berlin-grade comfort in ragusa with
my nomadic resources?

at the center of inspiration, empty

when down, feed yourself with satisfaction, according to your resources

let's leave the time for better things to happen

interferences disrupting my routine can free me

status empty
