i like writing upwards for elevating the thought but it started because of a limitation: on emacs i couldn't do empty writing without going bottom to top. then it merged with the natural intuition of a stack and the research about new priority




also writing has different dimensions of success
there is being authentic,
enjoy what you are doing
being comfortable and free
or making money
or living in a cool place
or feeling happy while doing it
or change something
or help someone, even when that doesn't change the world
and won't make you big on social media
and no, that won't give you money today
but maybe it'll make you a better person
and these are my dimensions of success
big like my hearth
and humble like my wallet
broken like my passion for music
and free like you can be only in virtuality
only in our minds, in our dreams,
in our free fall
