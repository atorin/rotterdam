events can be endogenic or esogenic
mixing channels
this way identity extends to all domains that are received
-> receptive strategies
since they involve feeling they seem romantic which is confusing
wandering, rooting, spacing can be seen as ways to affect the uncontrolled
planning and opting is just another way to react to imagination
symptom coherence, where feeling is a different form of understanding
expression rather than control
imperfection and openness
identity opens itself to react to events
this attitude gives me freedom to follow instinct and be open to interferences
pure reaction
lifting from the tail 
trying to project its will on the world
from control
starting from the mind

of hiding who they are to the community that grew them
which in many cases are their only personal connections to older generations

che vi appartengono completamente
vi offro una vetrina ed una maniglia
vi mostro la mia ossessione perché sia copiata
ospito lo spazio pubblico che voglio vivere

senza intermediazioni tecnologiche indesiderate
e giocare con essa
dove sono libero di lavorare sulla nostra cultura
creare uno spazio pubblico e privato
e mi piace sentirmi vicino alla gente
sono davvero comodo, e chiunque dalla strada può vedere il mio salotto

i'm online when i save the file, or when i commit
automatically pushing i'm online when i'm not

isolation creates direction
repetition creates dimension

technology enables us to disrupt routine, does it create a dependency?
