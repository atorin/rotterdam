today i met sebastiano, and it was a sparkle, a shock. he has the
positive energy, i have the negative. he is a drummer, i am a
dancer. he is the future, i am the past.

it's funny how until now i stagnated, suffered and struggled in
ragusa, but i built a base. and now the base reacted so strongly with
the acid, releasing energy.

i knew that he was there, and i had an intuition about something to be
exchanged between us. he sent me signals, i worked on my
position. today he released so much energy to me, apparently
presenting all the other pieces of the puzzle.

was it necessary for me to struggle, suffer and stagnate before this
happened? somehow i think it was. these are my negative energies
reacting so powerfully with his positive ones. moreover, that won't
stop. that's what i am and what i have to offer. our projects are
going to click with each other.

i know many who would accept the personal cost
of hiding who they are to the community that grew them
which in many cases are their only personal connections to older generations

che vi appartengono completamente
vi offro una vetrina ed una maniglia
vi mostro la mia ossessione perché sia copiata
ospito lo spazio pubblico che voglio vivere

senza intermediazioni tecnologiche indesiderate
e giocare con essa
dove sono libero di lavorare sulla nostra cultura
creare uno spazio pubblico e privato
e mi piace sentirmi vicino alla gente
sono davvero comodo, e chiunque dalla strada può vedere il mio salotto

i'm online when i save the file, or when i commit
