summoned loneliness

relax a bit in front of a page of code

and to tests
this applies to well written code in other languages too
the code responsible for a given behavior
where i'll find our answer
and more hopeful to be able to spot the place
haskell makes me more willing to go read the code
i can work way more effectively
in the cases when i'm free from this fear
like sketches or design
and invading a domain that's not my own
which is mostly defined by my past
getting out of my skill specialisation
as i can be afraid of breaking barriers
i reckon sometimes i'm afraid to go looking for an answer directly in the code

the amount of hours
and the outcome
did not show a big increase
despite trying the best rooting and gliding
an huge growth is not to be seen here
and social issues weight
there is some nice moment
and some satisfaction related to personal achievements and closing circles
which i might like better stronger
after opening other quantities
i can leave this good experience behind
and move on

amor es ser fiel sin que moleste

some results have been remarkable
i'm trying hard to do happy work
code as an art?
only as an artist i can enjoy my coding

it's shameful to live in a society where
the neutral response of a lady to a male look in the eyes
is to look down

se devo preoccuparmi di ogni persona che passa

es tan dificil para mi de salir del prejuicio para mi propria gente

find a place where
my tool connects me rather than isolating
than maybe come back with more happiness to give away

if i want to quit the closet i can do that
through my society

comunque lasciare questa casa
la parte migliore di questa casa
é la posizione
gianni, la rotonda

a veces me pregunto si puedo vivir viajando, si aqui estoy tan solo porque hago algo incorecto, o se lo incorecto que he hecho es de no tener una casa, de pensar de poter conectar communidades diferentes. ahora me encuentro solo, sin partenecer a nadie. tu quieres viajar aun mas que mi, no se como sabes gestionar la soledad, me gustaria saber hacerlo como ti pero toda la gente que veo quiere quedarse en un lugar, antes o despues. quizas tu nunca eres sola, en ningun lugar. yo tambien pensava de saber vivir asi ... ahora no soy mas tan seguro. no se si es esta ciudad, o las ciudades pequenas ... o la idea que no puede funcionar
muchas comunidades pero ninguna es la mia, y adaptarse parece costar mucho esfuerzo. quizas no es una vida posibile
quizás esa soledad arrastrò nuestra relación, y es demasiado pesada sobre qualquiera amistad, qualquiera relacion cerca ... en un sitio donde las relacciones son poquas. se pone demasiada presion.

time races

and the stress of unknown lost time
provides a direction for recovery
towards a goal

when one lives the day
it's normal to make guesses on a daily horizon

quality differs, one can have more slow hours or less intense hours
hipothesys quality x hours

including with peers, at work, with ourselves
all relationships go through a new negotiations
quindi questo apprentissaje tiene impacto sobre todas las relacciones
perché improvvisare é più vicino a quello che siamo
é un cambiamento profondo
chi non ci é abituato impara
vivendo più spontaneamente si é più felici

who thinks that electronic music is not political is wrong. there are very deep, minimal, progressive, sometimes diverse, safe and inclusive, sometimes free ideologies that communicate through our identities right when we can understand them better. in fact such ideologies are so disruptive that we can't use labels to describe them, just artists, experiences and passion
