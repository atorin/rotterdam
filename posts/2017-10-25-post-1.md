while i start expanding and freeing my routine, i still feel the
constraints of the routines that until yesterday were enforced

.

the stress of August is like a crack in my story, a place where an
object impacted on my system. some broken parts extend until now, the
others are just memories that reveal me something new

.

culture, society and expectations lead to rigidities even when one is
remote or nomading. i always knew it, but maybe not so clearly. i
wanted to challenge it and i did it

.

i was able to force things through my pain

.

i cannot freely stop that movement, now it has its own momentum, i
have to let it end
