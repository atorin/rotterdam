from the front bench where we are so visible and vulnerable. here in
the port full of different ships, here in the place of trade. here
anything can happen. this abandoned open stage belongs to all of
us. from here we see our ugly errors, from here we see our nature
abused and our hopes playing. from here anyone we can connect without
barriers, physically or virtually. from here we are all lords but not
slaves, because we are all poor in power but dangerous in freedom.
