maybe removing the indent from the doc would be enough?

 issue for pandoc
in cases where a left indent is present while reading from DOCX, [paragraphs are wrapped into a block quote](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/src/Text/Pandoc/Readers/Docx.hs#L545-L546). this helps producing an output which is visually close to the input and it's a way to detect [parts of the text that were meant to be quoted](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/test/Tests/Readers/Docx.hs#L256).
we have some problems with this logic when it comes to documents where a left indent is used extensively across the whole document. the visual structure of the document is broken when converting from DOCX to RST due to tables and headers not being wrapped in block quotes. headers couldn't be wrapped in any case as this doesn't seem to be valid RST syntax.

this is a good motivation for working in the code rather than in a filter
how to know which blockquotes should be removed and which ones should be kept?

a possibility is to write a filter to remove quotes

the table can be quoted
it looks like they can't, a syntax error is triggered when i try
can headings be quoted?

what is the feature that causes the paragraphs to be translated into quotes? does it extend to the other elements as well?

in reduced-2, one can see that "check" and the table are out of the
quoted paragraph, like the main title. this applies to many elements
in test3.rst
