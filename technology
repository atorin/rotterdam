in a game, technology can be seen as something designed to win a
strategical advantage over other agents, and as such it must involve
some restriction on the access competitors have to it

for example the water mill provides to the mill owner an advantage
over owners of manual mills with all their workers

since that technology is capitalizable it ends up providing a class
advantage, but proprietary technologies could provide advantages in
the market instead
