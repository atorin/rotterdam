alberto at this point i am tackling warnings in the cells

it's frequent also in the rest of test4
and it seems caused by wrapping lines in a table
is the most frequent error
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
reduced-2 contains all warnings errors in the cells of the first table

removing the backslash doesn't seem to affect the warnings for that cell
the main difference seems to be about the starting backslash
the content of the cell is correctly translated into HTML in reduced-1

the most relevant problem seems to be rst2html warnings

i have no way to tell whether is there actually a nested table or not,
table controls that show up when i focus the nested content refer to
the upmost table

alberto all'inizio del file c'Ã© una struttura incomprensibile anche in
libreoffice. abbiamo l'ambizione di tradurla in qualcosa?

presents same indentation problems as test3, but the new error here
seems to be in the tables
