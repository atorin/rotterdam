why wouldn't wrap=none also affect tables?

even with a wrap=none, the table is kept at around 70 columns
one would be to have broader tables, ignoring the line limit

but what's the alternative? is there any?
so it's clear now, multiple syntax errors are due to wrapped lines in a cell

it's at the beginning of a line which is wrapped to the next line

"interpreted or phrase ref" is the backtick

looking for the cause of the error in docutils

44 inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.
40 block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
15 inline strong start-string without end-string.
3  definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
 grep -ic "" rst2html/test4.html 

alberto at this point i am tackling warnings in the cells

it's frequent also in the rest of test4
and it seems caused by wrapping lines in a table
is the most frequent error
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
reduced-2 contains all warnings errors in the cells of the first table

removing the backslash doesn't seem to affect the warnings for that cell
the main difference seems to be about the starting backslash
the content of the cell is correctly translated into HTML in reduced-1

the most relevant problem seems to be rst2html warnings

i have no way to tell whether is there actually a nested table or not,
table controls that show up when i focus the nested content refer to
the upmost table

alberto all'inizio del file c'Ã© una struttura incomprensibile anche in
libreoffice. abbiamo l'ambizione di tradurla in qualcosa?

presents same indentation problems as test3, but the new error here
seems to be in the tables
