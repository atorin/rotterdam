when one lives the day

who thinks that electronic music is not political is wrong. there are very deep, minimal, progressive, sometimes diverse, safe and inclusive, sometimes free ideologies that communicate through our identities right when we can understand them better. in fact such ideologies are so disruptive that we can't use labels to describe them, just artists, experiences and passion

will the form last or the content last?
the form is a content but also a form, the content is just content
so the form is the mark of the past, and the dimension of repetition

it will take the resources needed for following it
i cannot follow the complex plan if i understand it
