the first thing i gifted myself was a whole lot of public space
starting my work day. society shouldn't be like this. we are working
to change this

animale in una gabbia mentale

changing our idea of comfort takes opportunities

finding a new dimension in a relationship
or chatting with calm with a colleague
maybe it can be as simple as an idea arrived when we were with friends
not even the most remarkable
they being the first of a series of events, and maybe 
the impact of turning points seems disregardable soon

costruire in condizione di incertezza a livello governativo

siamo uomini non ingranaggi

con la preoccupazione del mangiare e dell'affitto
restare all'altezza della responsabilità

it's getting more and more productive

the pandoc wiki could host info about caption formats

that feature affects a small percentage of users

and a method
wouldn't we like to have a shared perspective on the horizon?
before diving into tasks

that's why opening the decision process is worth its cost

and its bottlenecks
we don't know the adoption we are going to support

so some formalization is needed
but the artifacts include the possibility of being handed over
of course it can be leaner
it feels odd to grow a process for a single dev

che è la cosa più importante che abbiamo
cioè della nostra efficace collaborazione
sono l'ossatura della nostra comunicazione interna
ma più accessibili
con un'usabilità inferiore ad altre tecnologie
web apps

i put it here in front of everyone

effective work is more enjoyable
