con la preoccupazione del mangiare e dell'affitto
è difficile sentirsi all'altezza della responsabilità

it's getting more and more productive

because i'm drifting from yet another source
this is now yet a different drift

not even structured nor that static
code is good as a source but many sources are not formalised
whichever frame is unsuited to an everchanging source

from that point on it's a channel towards the unknown
a root can provide a foundation

definitely habits hardly keep up with everchanging needs

ed in effetti scardina abitudini abbastanza consolidate

drifting from a source is preferable than aiming

code cave

growing complexity as a feature of successful sourcing

the pandoc wiki could host info about caption formats

that feature affects a small percentage of users

and a method
wouldn't we like to have a shared perspective on the horizon?
before diving into tasks

that's why opening the decision process is worth its cost

and its bottlenecks
we don't know the adoption we are going to support

so some formalization is needed
but the artifacts include the possibility of being handed over
of course it can be leaner
it feels odd to grow a process for a single dev

che è la cosa più importante che abbiamo
cioè della nostra efficace collaborazione
sono l'ossatura della nostra comunicazione interna

ma più accessibili
con un'usabilità inferiore ad altre tecnologie
web apps

i put it here in front of everyone

effective work is more enjoyable
