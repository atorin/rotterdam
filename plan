prod -> enjoy
              -> hours
              -> clients

the current average is 2. i aim at an average of 3 in September, 4 in
October. So i aim for more than 30 hours on the 10th of September

visualising the data, since when i travel i dropped the hours per
day. my intention now is to increase the hours per day to full time
which is about 4 excluding the current client.

in the next months i want to increase the number of hours and find a
new client.
