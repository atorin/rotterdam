the project finished and i am now recovering faster

changes of direction in my main project disrupted even more contextual
efforts

the past week has been disruptive and i resorted to volunteering a lot
in order to fill the gap. October just started but i'm blocked and
with no stock

22 september

i've been working on productivity in the past weeks and i'm satisfied
about the results

in order to enjoy my work more i want to feel more productive

in June, July and August i felt like my productivity was threatened by
the environment i've been living in. by the end of August my
operations collapsed and i could protect only the essential work for
my main client. in order to restore operations i feel the need to also
restore the resources i can devote to work, starting from time.
visualising the data, looks like unpaid hours per day have been
monotonically decreasing since when i started nomading. my intention
now is to increase the hours per day to full time which is about 4
excluding the current client. the current average is 2. i aim at an
average of 3 in September, 4 in October. So i aim for more than 30
hours on the 10th of September. i don't aim for more hours directly,
but i aim for enjoying more my daily work in order to work better

work with more clients

develop my profession
