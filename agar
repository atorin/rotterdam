So i met this fantastic lady, and she thought me about Buddhism, about
detachment from desires and from the ego. This resonated a lot with
the experience i was having those days, as a virgin burner. I met a
more experienced burner that told me "it's visible you are a virgin,
you are all so eager". Not even greedy, eager. And yeah, she was
right, that attitude was a problem.

Greediness leads us to push our experimentations slightly too beyond
our comfort zone and other people's comfort zone, and the last thing i
want is to make a fellow burner feel uncomfortable ... unless they ask
for it.

I looked for her at Eat Your Art Out, and came back several days in
order to know her and her teachings better. She turned out to be very
knowledgeable about the topic and ended up being my extemporaneous
master. The more she talked the more i felt connected with her in a
deep way, but the more i listened her the more she thought me how to
detach from things we desire. I desired this connection to continue,
but i was trying hard not to force things. She had a name that was new
for me, Agar, and i was sure to meet her again through Facebook.
Unfortunately that was not the case, as it didn't work for Said; i
can't find those names here around.

maybe didn't learn and i still need my teacher
