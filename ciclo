including with peers, at work, with ourselves
all relationships go through a new negotiations
quindi questo apprentissaje tiene impacto sobre todas las relacciones
perché improvvisare é più vicino a quello che siamo
é un cambiamento profondo

vivendo più spontaneamente si é più felici

who thinks that electronic music is not political is wrong. there are very deep, minimal, progressive, sometimes diverse, safe and inclusive, sometimes free ideologies that communicate through our identities right when we can understand them better. in fact such ideologies are so disruptive that we can't use labels to describe them, just artists, experiences and passion

when an engine is broken nothing is going on through it, calma piatta
and you can move freely and the task at hand is uninteresting
if expectations are ambitious it could take a while
before the engine will start running again
and that is the moment when it can start accelerating

i can follow the spontaneous clues and reflect levels
it will take the resources needed for following it
i cannot follow the complex plan if i understand it

Kim Albrecht’s talk will show how glitches reveal the inner workings of the systems we trust everyday and how visualisations can help us in our algorithm-driven society.

Kim Albrecht visualizes cultural, technological, and scientific forms of knowledge. His diagrams are meant to unfold and question the structures of representation and explore the aesthetic of the intermingling of technology and society through the sensual knowledge of tracing information.

Peter Crnokrak’s talk will focus on the historical dynamics of war and conflict and its effect on human creative output by surveying the last 500 years of scientific discoveries and artistic creations.

Peter Crnokrak is a computational artist whose work addresses the ever changing reference point of reality and experience, with a particular focus on the extremes of societal behaviour as a means by which to characterise the human condition. His practice is an experimental platform that utilises symbolic logic to communicate meaning in complex systems with work integrating research, analysis and experimental technologies.

thought is still predated
in different ways
but our society accepts most of them
like in a advertisement
and we know some of them
with tools that became more sophisticated over time
by agents of social control
it's also an activity that's been always predated
it's in generela not an easy activity in itself
probably neve r been that easy to think
it's easier to be brainwashed
because it's not so easy for us to think
and i imagine other people are in the same situation
or do it right or the way i like it
and i've probably always wanted to do more of it
but i often had to look for it elsewhere
i actually always enjoyed it a lot
now i realise
to spend time thinking
i wouldn't feel allowed
because i couldn't enjoy thinking because
i couldn't think the way i liked
