a stair through the european scene

since when i was a kid
one of my paths
musik gewinnt freunde
dance is my society

the uncolonized ones
or maybe now folk cultures?
for thriving rather than research
or maybe spain european cultures are the easiest different to access
in a respectful way
to me
the latin american is the easiest to access
abya yala, china, africa
among the cultures of dance and body
i'd be in a closet in most italian and european cities
