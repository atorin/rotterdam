if are you looking for accommodation in a popular destination, there
are many others like you and the local communities are usually already
receiving different forms of pressure from who wants to move in. in
order to be respectful of the communities you are going to visit, you
need first to understand whether they are interested in your visit and
in which terms.

understanding a local culture might take time, and if you don't want
to spend that time, the locals could expect you to pay in exchange for
their hospitality. note that you can be asked to pay, but you cannot
expect to pay for what is not for sale. if you don't want to spend
time connecting with the local culture and you don't want to spend
money either, this is no reason for lacking respect of the local
communities, trying to force things or abusing of their hospitality.
