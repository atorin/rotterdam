Explorable explanation of mathematical proofs like the consistency,
availability, partitioning theorem.

With the mathematics, but my stile, really essential.

I don't read many proofs because proofs are hard, like data, but
understanding proofs gives insight.

It conveys a deeper understanding than just by using or remembering
the result. One cannot help but believing it or working towards its
falsification.

Often proofs also involve storytelling.
