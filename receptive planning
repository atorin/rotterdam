sober sad comfortable space on a sunny sunday morning at home naroma alx
starting from the mind
from control
trying to project its will on the world
lifting from the tail 
pure reaction
this attitude gives me freedom to follow instinct and be open to interferences
identity opens itself to react to events
imperfection and openness
expression rather than control
symptom coherence, where feeling is a different form of understanding
planning and opting is just another way to react to imagination
wandering, rooting, spacing can be seen as ways to affect the uncontrolled
since they involve feeling they seem romantic which is confusing
this way identity extends to all domains that are received
mixing channels
events can be endogenic or esogenic
