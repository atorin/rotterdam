It's not easy for me now to get out of the state of tension, and that
prevents me from thinking, from working like i want. I never had to
get into this state in the first place. I found myself in similar
situations other times, and often the solution is to pay more than
usual, in order to get back to where you want to be. I already started
paying more than usual for this, but it's still not enough. I can
observe some improvements though, i'll keep trying.

How to approach this? ðŸ¤”
