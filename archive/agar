So i met this fantastic lady, and she thought me about Buddhism, about detachment from desires and from the ego. It resonated a lot with the experience i was having those days, as a virgin burner. Another experienced burner told me "it's visible you are a virgin, you are all so eager". Not even greedy, eager. And yeah, she was right, that attitude was a problem.

Greediness leads us to push our experimentations slightly too beyond our comfort zone and other people's comfort zone, and the last thing i want is to make a fellow burner feel uncomfortable.

I looked for her at Eat Your Art Out, and came back several days in order to know her and her teachings better. She turned out to be very knowledgeable about the topic and ended up being my teacher of Buddhism. The more she talked the more i felt connected with her in a deep way, but the more i listened to her the more she thought me how to detach from things we desire.

I desired this connection to continue. I mean, besides being a Buddhist master she is also a very attractive woman. She had a name that was new for me: Agar. I was sure to meet her again through Facebook. Unfortunately that was not the case, as it didn't work for Said; i can't find those names here around, but maybe you can.

Well i've been thinking about her a lot and i didn't try to reach her. I thought that being detached was the best way to express my deep appreciacion ... or ... is it? I mean ... yeah maybe i'm not that detached. Maybe i could still take a class or two. So does anybody have her contact, pretty please??
