first the night gets less dark
then a slow conflict and a slow fire irritate the sky
it bleeds and it's beautiful
at that point, light starts being everywhere
birds sing, fishes populate the sea
the sky is so quiet now, it's already day, it's almost boring
and the sun it's still not there

the sun, maybe we don't need it, after all
we forget about it
it's day, a boring day, everything is there, the sky is ours
then some parts of the sky, some clouds, start looking funny
strokes of light on them, catch our eye
then the strokes of light blur, and expand
the sky seemed bright, but it keeps changing
we didn't expect more light, yet it keeps glowing
it starts feeling glorious, and the sun is still not there

now we don't really need it
this is enough, this is plenty, this is everything we wanted
the sun is there
